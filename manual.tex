\section{Introduction}
\texttt{netsplit-macros} is a package that helps writing (my) papers. It is an opinionated set of macros, functions, and settings that I use when writing papers alone or within a group.

Most of these commands are shortcut for common packages, such as \texttt{todonotes} or \texttt{soul}.

\paragraph{Acknowledgements} The idea of functions named against authors comes from the macros used by prof. Gabriele Tolomei of Sapienza University of Rome.

\section{How to use in your project}

Copy the \texttt{netsplit-macros.sty} file in your project, and use the package in your main \LaTeX file (before \texttt{\textbackslash begin\{document\}}.

\begin{minted}{latex}
\usepackage{netsplit-macros}
\end{minted}

Then, you can use any command described below. If you need to use an option, use the square brackets:

\begin{minted}{latex}
\usepackage[final]{netsplit-macros}
\end{minted}


\section{Package options}
\label{sec:options}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{largepage}: set the size of the page to 275.9mm x 279.4mm (larger than \texttt{letter}) to accomodate non-inline ``TODO notes''. Useful when writing paper in some IEEE double column templates.
    \item \texttt{nolargepage}: force disable the \texttt{largepage} automation (see~\autoref{sec:automation}).
    \item \texttt{final}: disable all changes and commands (commands still exists, they are aliased to no-op functions).
    \item \texttt{changebar}: loads the \texttt{changebar} environment (or a no-op when used with \texttt{final}). This is optional as some conference templates have issues with that.
\end{itemize}


\section{Automation}
\label{sec:automation}

This package, when loaded, applies automatically some changes to the paper, \textbf{except when the \texttt{final} option is used} (in that case, nothing is applied):

\begin{itemize}
	\item if the document class \texttt{IEEEtran} is detected, the \texttt{largepage} option is automatically used (see options in~\autoref{sec:options}).
\end{itemize}


\section{Macros/commands}

\subsection{\B{SetMaxPageBackground}}

The \B{SetMaxPageBackground} command enables a conditional background for pages. It is useful to visually mark pages that are beyond certain limits for the submission. \textbf{This command goes in the \textit{preamble} (before the \textbackslash begin\{document\}}).

It requires two arguments, one for a yellow warning, and one for the red warning. Pages after the first argument will be colored in yellow, while pages beyond the second argument will be colored in red. If both arguments are the same number, the yellow warning will be ignored.

E.g., if your conference/journal requires 10 page max excluding references, and 12 page max including references, you can use the following:

\begin{minted}{latex}
\SetMaxPageBackground{10}{12}
\end{minted}

\subsection{\B{macronames}}

The \B{macronames} command defines new macros with a specific name and color. I use this kind of macros for notes while writing/reviewing the paper, defining macros using author's names. The name is restricted to LaTeX command names, so I suggest to use a nickname. \textbf{This command goes in the \textit{preamble} (before the \textbackslash begin\{document\}}).

\begin{minted}{latex}
\macronames{enrico}{zgreen}
\end{minted}

(in this example, I used a custom color defined in the package; however, you can use any standard color or custom defined color). This command:

\begin{itemize}
    \item creates a new command named \B{enrico} that you can use to show an ``inline note'' (colored in \texttt{teal}). The parameter is the note content/text.
    \item creates a new command named \B{hlenrico}, which has two parameters: first, the note content/text, and second, the highlighted part. It creates a note (colored in \texttt{teal}) in the page margin, and draw a line from the note to the highlighted text.
    \item creates also a ``star'' version of the two commands above (e.g., \B{enrico*}. These commands draw the note in gray with a line over the text (as if you mark the note as ``done'').
    \item registers \texttt{enrico} as author in the \texttt{changes} package as author, associating the \texttt{teal} color to the author's changes.
\end{itemize}

The new commands/macros defined by \B{macronames} can't be used in the preamble.

To see a list of all todo notes, you can use the \texttt{todonotes} command \B{listoftodos}. It has been enhanced so that it prints the list of notes in a new page, and it automatically fixes the TOC level (useful in templates such as \texttt{lncs}).

\subsubsection{Examples}

\begin{minted}{latex}

\enrico{this is an inline note}

This is a text \hlenrico{this is a side note with highlighted text}{in the page}.

\enrico*{this is an inline note added with the star command}

\added[id=enrico]{This is a text added (from the \texttt{changes} package).}

\edoardo{This is another author}

\end{minted}

\enrico{this is an inline note}

This is a text \hlenrico{this is a side note with highlighted text}{in the page}.

\enrico*{this is an inline note added with the star command}

\added[id=enrico]{This is a text added (from the \texttt{changes} package).}

\edoardo{This is another author}

\subsection{\texttt{locked} environment}

Sometimes you want to ``mark'' a specific area of the paper, telling other authors that you don't want them to edit it. This is mostly useful when using an interactive/multi-user editor like Overleaf. The \texttt{locked} environment defines a section that is ``locked'' by a specific person by marking the area, so that other authors knows that they are not supposed to modify it.

\subsubsection{Example}

\begin{minted}{latex}
This is a text in a paragraph. You are free to modify it.
\begin{locked}{enrico}
This section is reported as locked by one of the authors.
\end{locked}
\end{minted}

This is a text in a paragraph. You are free to modify it.
\begin{locked}{enrico}
This section is reported as locked by one of the authors.
\end{locked}


\subsection{Custom colors}

I defined the following colors:

\begin{itemize}
    \foreach \n in {zyellow,zred,zgreen,zblue,zpurple,zmagenta,zorange,zgray}{\item \C{\n} \texttt{\n}}
\end{itemize}



\clearpage

\noindent This page is colored yellow as I have set a limit of four pages using:
\begin{minted}{latex}
\SetMaxPageBackground{4}{6}
\end{minted}

\clearpage

\noindent As the page before, this is yellow as it is over the warning threshold.

\clearpage

\noindent This page is colored red as I have set a limit of six pages using:
\begin{minted}{latex}
\SetMaxPageBackground{4}{6}
\end{minted}

\noindent Every page after this one will be red as well.

\end{document}
