# `netsplit-macros` LaTeX package

`netsplit-macros` is a package that helps writing (my) papers. It is an opinionated set of macros, functions, and settings that I use when writing papers alone or within a group.

Read the [manual.pdf](manual.pdf) for the usage manual.

Code is licensed as stated in the `netsplit-macros.sty` source.
